## Hi there! I'm Amy

👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am an experienced molecular biologist with a strong background in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques, laboratory procedures, and data analysis. Now, I’m excited to leverage my wet lab knowledge and transition into bioinformatics.

🍁 Although I don't have direct real-world bioinformatics experience yet, I have proactively taken courses on platforms like Coursera, and DataCamp to build a strong foundational understanding of bioinformatics and data science. Through these courses, I have earned certificates that have provided me with the essential knowledge and skills to contribute effectively to bioinformatics workflows
