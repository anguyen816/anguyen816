## Hi there! I'm Amy

👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am an experienced molecular biologist with a strong background in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques, laboratory procedures, and data analysis. Now, I’m excited to leverage my wet lab knowledge and transition into bioinformatics.

🍁 Although I don't have direct real-world bioinformatics experience yet, I have proactively taken courses on platforms like Coursera, and DataCamp to build a strong foundational understanding of bioinformatics and data science. Through these courses, I have earned certificates that have provided me with the essential knowledge and skills to contribute effectively to bioinformatics workflows

🎓Certificates:
[Genomic Data Science](https://coursera.org/share/e06ef18bf3a16a96bb473e0f39a8105d), 
[AWS Cloud Technical Essential](https://coursera.org/share/357f5e1fde10d227f140ce6cdc0ea4b9),
[UC Sandiego bioinformatic 1.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17880253/uc.sandiego.bioinformatic.1.pdf)
